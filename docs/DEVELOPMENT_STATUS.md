# Current development status

Updated 2026-10-27. Base remote main: `4a8c660183910b0950ae7ddabce9e8b395a2f10d`.
Current local work: `fix/astra-review-phase-a`.
Validation outcomes for the working changes are recorded in the
[execution log](reviews/2026-10-27-astra-implementation-log.md).
Phase B progress and gates: [management integration log](reviews/2026-10-27-phase-b-log.md)
and [HTTP contract](WEB_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md).
The [parity audit](M2_5_PARITY_PLAN.md) supplies detailed source/test evidence.

PASS = verified at the named layer; PARTIAL = some implementation/wiring only;
OPEN = required work remains; NOT RUN = no physical execution evidence;
N/A = outside the named component. A host PASS never implies hardware PASS.

Guition board selection starts the scheduler and optional diagnostics. It does
not start the product USB/storage/audio owners. `integration-check` compiles
owner modules and intentionally cannot be combined with a board selector.
Standalone crate compilation does not establish a firmware dependency or wiring.

The simulator uses fixed demonstration tracks and per-process RAM settings;
Session controls do not render audible DSP. Decoder/render/packer tests run
separately against actual shared audio logic. `/`, assets, `/api/status`,
`/api/control`, `/api/library`, `/api/load`, profile/config upload and management
GET routes are implemented. Upload bodies are bounded, single-flight and
cancelled on deadline/EOF. Recording routes remain 501. The demo OTA upload
returns 503 because no trust/project/slot adapter has been selected; its full
HTTP→incremental install→boot/rollback path is tested with explicit synthetic
trust and the A/B device model in ruzina-ota.
Recorder remains outside R1; APTA remains OFF/unmerged for the product.

Remaining host/acceptance work includes permitted real-export/capture fixtures
and selecting the product OTA trust/project/slot adapter. The phase B log names
the implemented composition tests and remaining boundaries. Physical work follows
phase C after unit identity, backup and recovery.
Both Guition models need independent qualification. Headphones always remain on
the controller while an initialized external DAC may take stereo MAIN.
